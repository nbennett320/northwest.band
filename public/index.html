			"Suburban Dogs" is Northwest's second full-length album, released on
			November 15th, 2019. The album features 12 songs, all of which were 
			produced entirely by Lukas Needham and Noah Bennett, with the occasional
			help of drummer Blake Fletcher and bassist Hayden Carlson. Throughout the
			record there are recurring motifs of love, nostalgia, friendship, 
			as well as depression, anxiety, and regret. These themes manifest
			as the album progresses, as it loosely describes a plot of two lovers
			meeting, connecting, then falling out. The first track, "New Feel", 
			was finished and released by January of 2019.

		<p id="crawl">
			Northwest's debut album, "Area Code", was released on July 15th of
			2018. The album is comprised of 11 songs, all produced by best friends
			Lukas Needham and Noah Bennett. The album was originally meant to include
			a long overarching story, complete with a myriad of skits, interludes, and
			dialogue, but the idea was scrapped early on in the creation of the album.
			Despite the removal of much of the narrative content, the record's general
			premise remains a collection of thoughts, feelings, and inquiries into
			friendship, love, and self-image. After the album's inception, response by
			friends and peers was generally positive, and consequently lead to talk
			of live Northwest shows. Thus, Northwest added drummer Blake Fletcher -- a 
			childhood friend of Lukas -- and bassist Hayden Carlson -- a cousin 
			and childhood friend of Noah.
