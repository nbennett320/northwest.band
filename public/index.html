			Northwest is a band from Northwest Indiana, started before the summer of 2017. The first tracks came from
			Lukas Needham and Noah Bennett, though they weren't made seriously or with any intention of making a band.
			Though they were released as joke, their first works recieved surprisingly positive reception among friends
			and a very small community of listeners. As Lukas and Noah kept playing, recording, and hanging out, they 
			eventually became Northwest -- releasing their first album 'Area Code' on July 15th of 2018.

			Since its release, they've continued to work on music and began playing live shows -- adding drummer Blake 
			Fletcher, a long time friend of Lukas, and bassist Hayden Carlson, a cousin and best friend to Noah. 
			Their collaboration and further dedication to improving their musical ability has allowed for much more 
			cohesive projects, such as their second full length album 'Suburban Dogs', to come about.

			For booking or general inquiries regarding Northwest, email northwestband9@gmail.com.
