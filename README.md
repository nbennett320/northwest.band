## why open source?
in the words of richard stallman -- most software licenses are designed to take away your freedom to view, share, and change piece of software. the lack of transparency for transparency executed on your machine enables the vast majority of softwares and their respective proprietors to exploit users (often times without their informed consent _despite what is stated in the end user license or terms of service agreement_) by collecting and comodifying their data -- this practice often referred to as [big data collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) or [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism). free and open-source software is not a guarantee to privacy or internet safety, but neither can cannot exist without transparency. although open-sourcing this project is a microscopic contribution to the realm of free and open-source software, i want to do my part to show my appreciation for these communities and allow skeptics, creatives, or any other curious on-lookers to read and learn about what's going on behind the scenes.
