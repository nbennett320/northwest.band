## why open source?
most software licenses are designed to take away your freedom to view, share, and change it. furthermore, the lack of transparency for software enables the vast majority of softwares and their respective proprietors to exploit users by collecting and comodifying their data -- this practice often referred to as [big data collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) or [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism). free and open-source software is not a guarantee to privacy or internet safety, but neither can cannot exist without transparency. although open-sourcing this project is a microscopic contribution to the realm of free and open-source software, i wanted to do my part to show my appreciation for these communities and allow any curious on-lookers to read and learn about what's going on behind the scenes on the site.
